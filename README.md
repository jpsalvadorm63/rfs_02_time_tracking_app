02 - Components

This code comes fom the book
[Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/),
*Components*, 
plus some modifications. For example, I created
the project using the command `create-react-app`
from the OS. And I get a more organized structure
of component (in my sense as I hate two
components in the same file).
