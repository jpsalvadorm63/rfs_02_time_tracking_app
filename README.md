02 - Components

This code comes from the book
[Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/),
*Components*, 
some modifications. For example, I created
the project using the command `create-react-app`
from the OS; to create components I avoid using `React.createClass`, instead I use
the `React.Component`; I got a better organized structure
of components: each one in one file, etc.

    **_Facebook does suggest the future
    [removal of React.createClass](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/10/react-v0.13.html) completely in favour of ES6 classes_**
