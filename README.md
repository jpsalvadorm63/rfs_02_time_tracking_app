02 - Components

This code comes from the book
[Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/),
*Components*, 
some modifications. For example, I created
the project using the command `create-react-app`
from the OS command line; to create components I avoid using `React.createClass`, instead I use
the `React.Component`; I got a better organized structure
of components: each one in one file, etc.
